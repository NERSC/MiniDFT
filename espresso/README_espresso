This directory provides Quantum Espresso input files that are equivalent 
to the MiniDFT benchmark calculations. Although the input options for 
MiniDFT reproduce those of QE, MiniDFT uses a different format for 
pseudopotential files because miniDFT does not include QE's I/O toolkit.

MiniDFT developers should use these input files to ensure that the Mini-DFT mini-app reproduces both the physics and the computational profile of the full-application (i.e. Quantum Espresso.)

The QE documention includes instructions for building QE. The README 
file in this directory describes the procedure for running the miniDFT 
benchmark calculations. The same instructions can be followed using the 
pw.x executable from the QE package.
